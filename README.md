# IX83-GUI-Qt
This is a Olympus IX83 PC control software written in Qt.  
Due to the SDK library provided by Olympus, this project must use MSVC to build.

Check my other open-source project [IX83Server](https://github.com/ZhengyiZ/IX83Server) to create your own IX83 control software, which can be implemented using a wide range of programming languages.
