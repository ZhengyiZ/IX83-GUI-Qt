# IX83-GUI-Qt
This repository contains Olympus IX83 PC control software (GUI) developed using Qt.
Please note that due to the reliance on the Olympus SDK library, this project requires building with MSVC.

## Interfacing with Different Programming Languages
Check my other open-source project [IX83Server](https://github.com/ZhengyiZ/IX83Server) to create your own IX83 control software, which can be implemented using a wide range of programming languages.
